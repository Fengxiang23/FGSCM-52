## ðŸ”¥ News
* **`2024.11.25`** ðŸŒŸ Paper is accepted by TGRS.
* **`2024.11.28`** ðŸŒŸ FGSCM-52 now has a [huggingface version]() and a [baidu version]().
* **`2024.11.29`** ðŸŒŸ Paper now has a new version [paper]().

## ðŸ‘€ Intruduction
-  `FGSCM-52`: We contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes. </br>
- `Method`: We introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design. Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network. This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features.

## FGSCM-52
FGSCM-52 has 52 categories, it includes an additional ten categories and increases the number of samples across existing categories, thereby making it serve as a better testbed for fine-grained ship classification. The dataset features image sizes ranging from 50*50 to 1,600*1,700 pixels. %This significant size variation of ship instances in RS-FGSC necessitates specialized handling. Furthermore, FGSCM-52 is equipped with well-defined hierarchical labels, which facilitate a more nuanced understanding of ship classifications. For a comprehensive overview of the FGSCM-52 dataset, please refer to Fig.
